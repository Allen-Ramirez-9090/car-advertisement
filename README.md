Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Create a GitHub account and repository with a README.md and .gitignore file.
Set up a Python virtual environment and install required packages for data processing and visualization.
Link the project to Render via GitHub, clone the repo locally, and configure the Python interpreter in VS Code.
Step 2: Download the Dataset

Obtain the car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv) or use an alternative CSV file.
Place the dataset in the root directory of the project.
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Create a Jupyter notebook (EDA.ipynb) in VS Code for data exploration.
Save the notebook in the notebooks directory and perform exploratory analysis using the plotly-express library to generate histograms and scatterplots.
Step 4: Develop the Web Application Dashboard

Create app.py in the projectâ€™s root directory and import necessary libraries: streamlit, pandas, and plotly.express.
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display histograms and plots.
Update the README.md file to explain the project and its functionality.
Step 5: Deploy the Application

Prepare the project for deployment to Render by creating the requirements.txt and .streamlit/config.toml files.
List the required project dependencies in requirements.txt.
Deploy the Streamlit app to Render for public access: https://car-advertisement-3831.onrender.com/
